# Changelog

## Unreleased - a self-update can no longer quietly revert a fix

`bin/gm-mcp-server.js` on `main` is the live release channel: every deployed
`~/.gm-tools/gm-mcp-server.mjs` swaps itself for it within the hour. That swap
is a bare file overwrite, so a release that loses a fix silently undoes it on
the machine -- which is exactly what happened to `windowsHide: true` on two
child spawns (`execFileSync("git", ...)` and `spawnSync(process.execPath,
["--check", ...])`), present in `src/` and in the committed bundle and missing
from the 2026-10-04 08:57 release build.

Three guards now gate `replaceDeployedBundle`:

- **Freeze**: `GM_MCP_NO_SELF_UPDATE` set to anything but `0`/`false`/`no`/
  `off`, or a `gm-mcp-server.no-self-update` file in `$AGENTPLUG_HOME` (else
  `~/.agentplug`), refuses every self-update before any network call.
- **Local-build pin**: `gm-mcp pin-local-build [path]` records the installed
  bundle's sha256, path, version and ts in `gm-mcp-server.local-build.json`;
  while the installed bundle's sha256 matches, the channel may not overwrite
  it. `unpin-local-build` clears it and `self-update-status` reports the whole
  state. Pinning a bundle you built by hand is what keeps a local fix local.
- **No downgrade**: the candidate's version must be strictly greater than the
  installed `BUNDLE_VERSION` (`src/bundle-version.js`, compared numerically
  component by component). Equal, older, or unreadable versions are refused.

Every refusal logs `refusing deployed bundle self-update (<code>) -- <reason>`
to stderr, so it reaches the daemon log instead of vanishing into the
background check. The `.prev` backup and the `node --check` validation of a
candidate are unchanged. `BUNDLE_VERSION` is 0.2.3 and must be bumped with
every release: a release that keeps the installed version is refused.

## Unreleased - a dispatch to a dead daemon fails fast instead of hanging

The daemon self-recycles every few minutes (see AGENTS.md "Runner recovery"),
and a dispatch sent into a recycle used to discover that only at the poll
timeout: the ticket was written, sat `queued_not_yet_claimed`, and the caller
waited out its whole `timeout_seconds` -- 120 s by default -- for an answer
that was never coming. The `daemon` liveness block already said `alive: false`
with a heartbeat 157 s stale; nothing acted on it.

`gmDispatch` now checks liveness before writing. A project whose heartbeat is
stale and whose `pid` is gone gets a runner restart and `DAEMON_START_GRACE_MS`
(15 s) to come back, and only then answers `error: daemon-not-running`,
carrying the heartbeat age, `~/.agentplug/daemon.log`, the spool log, the
`.status.json` it read and the one-line restart command -- and no ticket is
written, so nothing is left queued behind a daemon that will never claim it.
A project with no `.status.json` is the registration path rather than a dead
daemon and still dispatches, as does one inside `daemonBootGraceActive` or a
`runner_update_in_progress` handoff, where a stale heartbeat is expected and
transient. Opt out with `GM_MCP_DAEMON_PREFLIGHT=0`.

The stale-heartbeat note no longer points at a `daemon.log` that does not exist
in a project: it names `~/.agentplug/daemon.log` and the project's
`.watcher.log`, and both now carry the restart command.

## Unreleased - a recall reply stops repeating every hit twice

A `recall` reply returned the ranked rows twice: once in `hits`, once in
`vector_hits`, with the same `key` and the same truncated `text`. The two
lists float-differ in `score` and `cos`, so the existing byte-identical row
collapse could not merge them, and every hit's prose crossed the wire twice.

`compactWireResponse` now drops `vector_hits` when every row in it is already
in `hits` -- the case where the fused list is exactly the vector candidates --
and names it in `wire_compacted.omitted`. It keeps `vector_hits` whenever it
carries a row `hits` does not, so the degraded paths that report an error
there and the `codesearch` replies whose `vector_hits` and `bm25_hits` are
independent retrieval channels are untouched. `full_response: true` still
returns both lists byte for byte.

## Unreleased - fs_read reads whole files, and the verb name is honest

`fs_read` came back truncated at 400 chars with a pointer to the out-file, so
reading a whole file through the tool was impossible and callers fell back to
a host file-read tool. The daemon-side `fs_read` was never the cause: its own
`offset`/`limit`/`max_bytes` were being cut down again by the generic
long-prose cap in `cleanResponse`. `fs_read` now gets its own budget
(`FILE_READ_INLINE_MAX`, 65536, env `GM_MCP_FILE_READ_INLINE_MAX`), and a new
`max_chars` MCP argument overrides every text budget for one dispatch
(ceiling 1048576). `full_response: true` now lifts the text cap too, so its
"every field verbatim" description is true.

The `verb` argument's description now says the verb set belongs to the running
build and names the real replacement for the four names callers keep guessing:
`fs_readdir` for `fs_list`, `grep`/`codesearch` with a body `glob` filter for
`fs_glob`/`glob`, and `bash`/`exec_js` with `raw_body` for `exec_bash`.

`typescript` is gone from the plain-text verb list. The running build has no
`typescript` verb: dispatching it answered `unknown_verb`, and because the
list routed it down the `raw_body` path the daemon could not even parse the
body (`body_parse_error: true`). Naming it there sent callers to a verb that
cannot work.

## 0.2.2 - a missing runner binary fails fast instead of timing out

When `agentplug-runner` was not installed at `~/.gm-tools/agentplug-runner`,
`ensureSpoolRunnerRunning()` returned without spawning anything, and a fresh
dispatch was still written to the spool. It could never be claimed, so the
caller waited out the full poll timeout and got the generic "daemon may not
have picked up this project" note, with no hint that the runner binary was
absent. A fresh dispatch now checks for the binary before writing: with no
runner and no live daemon heartbeat it returns `error: runner-not-installed`
with the install command instead of queueing. A live shared daemon
short-circuits the check, so projects served by a running daemon are
unaffected. The daemon-liveness note in a timeout reply also names the missing
binary when it applies.

## 0.2.1 - exec-family bodies get a timeoutMs line

gm rejects an `exec_js` body that has no `timeoutMs=<ms>` line. Two bare
bodies sent through the `gm` tool failed with `invalid_args: missing
timeoutMs`, although the tool already carried `timeout_seconds`. The server
now adds `timeoutMs=<timeout_seconds * 1000>` as the first line for `exec_js`,
its aliases, and every language stem. A body that already starts with
`timeoutMs=` or `timeout_ms=` is sent unchanged. `serp`, `browser` and `cdp`
are not changed. The README documents the rule under "Exec-family timeout
prefix".

The plain-text verb list now also names the exec_js aliases (`nodejs`,
`javascript`, `node`, `js`, `typescript`) and the shell aliases (`sh`,
`shell`, `zsh`, `py`, `ps1`). The server refuses a JSON `body` for one of
them with the same message as for `exec_js`.
