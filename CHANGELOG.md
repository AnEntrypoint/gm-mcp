## 0.2.2 - a missing runner binary fails fast instead of timing out

When `agentplug-runner` was not installed at `~/.gm-tools/agentplug-runner`,
`ensureSpoolRunnerRunning()` returned without spawning anything, and a fresh
dispatch was still written to the spool. It could never be claimed, so the
caller waited out the full poll timeout and got the generic "daemon may not
have picked up this project" note, with no hint that the runner binary was
absent. A fresh dispatch now checks for the binary before writing: with no
runner and no live daemon heartbeat it returns `error: runner-not-installed`
with the install command instead of queueing. A live shared daemon
short-circuits the check, so projects served by a running daemon are
unaffected. The daemon-liveness note in a timeout reply also names the missing
binary when it applies.

## 0.2.1 - exec-family bodies get a timeoutMs line

gm rejects an `exec_js` body that has no `timeoutMs=<ms>` line. Two bare
bodies sent through the `gm` tool failed with `invalid_args: missing
timeoutMs`, although the tool already carried `timeout_seconds`. The server
now adds `timeoutMs=<timeout_seconds * 1000>` as the first line for `exec_js`,
its aliases, and every language stem. A body that already starts with
`timeoutMs=` or `timeout_ms=` is sent unchanged. `serp`, `browser` and `cdp`
are not changed. The README documents the rule under "Exec-family timeout
prefix".

The plain-text verb list now also names the exec_js aliases (`nodejs`,
`javascript`, `node`, `js`, `typescript`) and the shell aliases (`sh`,
`shell`, `zsh`, `py`, `ps1`). The server refuses a JSON `body` for one of
them with the same message as for `exec_js`.
