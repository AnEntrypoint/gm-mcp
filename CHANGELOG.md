## 0.2.1 - exec-family bodies get a timeoutMs line

gm rejects an `exec_js` body that has no `timeoutMs=<ms>` line. Two bare
bodies sent through the `gm` tool failed with `invalid_args: missing
timeoutMs`, although the tool already carried `timeout_seconds`. The server
now adds `timeoutMs=<timeout_seconds * 1000>` as the first line for `exec_js`,
its aliases, and every language stem. A body that already starts with
`timeoutMs=` or `timeout_ms=` is sent unchanged. `serp`, `browser` and `cdp`
are not changed. The README documents the rule under "Exec-family timeout
prefix".

The plain-text verb list now also names the exec_js aliases (`nodejs`,
`javascript`, `node`, `js`, `typescript`) and the shell aliases (`sh`,
`shell`, `zsh`, `py`, `ps1`). The server refuses a JSON `body` for one of
them with the same message as for `exec_js`.
